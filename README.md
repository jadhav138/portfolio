# portfolio


Client Background 

You are a Cloud Engineer who wants to build a modern, professional portfolio website to showcase your projects and skills. While popular website builders exist, you recognize that building and deploying a cloud-native portfolio will itself demonstrate your cloud engineering capabilities. Additionally, you want to implement CI/CD practices to make updates seamless and automated.

Solution Overview 

We'll build a modern portfolio website that demonstrates cloud engineering excellence by:

Creating a responsive Next.js application

Deploying it using AWS Amplify

Setting up automated deployments from GitHub

Implementing CI/CD best practices

Current Situation 

Many cloud engineers face the challenge of effectively presenting their work. Their portfolios often suffer from:

Manual deployment processes that slow down updates

Limited ability to showcase real cloud projects

Basic hosting that doesn't demonstrate cloud expertise

No way to automatically update when they add new projects

Static sites that don't show full-stack capabilities

AWS Components:

AWS Amplify for hosting and CI/CD

Route 53 for domain management (optional)

CloudFront for content delivery

S3 for static asset storage

Your Task

1. Create Modern Portfolio Site

Set up Next.js project with TypeScript

Use vercel v0 to create a portfolio UI

Implement responsive design


2. Configure AWS Amplify with CDK

Initialize a new CDK TypeScript project for Amplify configuration

Create an Amplify App construct that connects to your GitHub repository

Configure the build specification for Next.js applications

Deploy your infrastructure using CDK


3. Test and Deploy

Test local development

Verify build process

Check automated deployments

Validate performance

What You'll Learn

Modern web development with Next.js

AWS Amplify deployment workflows

CI/CD best practices

Cloud-native portfolio development

Infrastructure as Code concepts

This project is carefully designed to teach you both modern web development and cloud deployment practices. We'll start with the basics and progressively add more advanced features as your understanding grows.
